# _Caitlin & Dimitar's Wedding Registry_

#### _A personalized registry website created by the sister of the bride, 12 July 2020_

#### By _**Jacqueline Remmel**_

## Description

Instead of a typical registry at a store, the bride and groom are giving their friends and family members the opportunity to contribute to four different funds to support their various life goals. This React site features a chart where guests can see what percentage of gifts have been given to each fund so far, fill out a form to add their own gift to the chart's calculation, and leave a note for the happy couple if they so desire.
